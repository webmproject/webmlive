google-glog
Logging library.

Version: 0.3.3
URL: https://google-glog.googlecode.com/files/glog-0.3.3.tar.gz


Building
CMake v2.8.11 or higher is required. To create project files, run the command:
$ cmake path/to/webmlive/third_party/glog

CMake will generate project (or makefiles, depending on the generator). On
Windows machines CMake attempts to find the latest version of Microsoft Visual
Studio installed on the system.

The CMakeLists.txt for google-glog was written for use with Visual Studio 12.
If your system has a newer version of Microsoft Visual Studio, it can be
overridden using the -G parameter.
For example, to force use of VS2013 use "Visual Studio 12" with the -G parameter
passed to cmake:
$ cmake path/to/webmlive/third_party/glog -G "Visual Studio 12"
