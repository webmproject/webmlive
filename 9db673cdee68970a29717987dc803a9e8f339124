      "message": "Note that you cannot assume that you have an end_time here; you only check for !FAILED but that\u0027s not the same as S_OK.  There is a specific success for that means \"this sample has a start time, but no stop time\", and it\u0027s a success code.  If you require both start and stop timestamps, then you need to test the condition (hr !\u003d S_OK).",

DShow is designed to avoid copying samples -- that\u0027s why you pass around objects by reference, that implement the IMediaSample type.  It would have been hipper you had a custom allocator, with a custom media sample, that also supports a VideoFrame interface.  Then your allocator pool could serve the same purpose as your VideoFrameQueue.",
